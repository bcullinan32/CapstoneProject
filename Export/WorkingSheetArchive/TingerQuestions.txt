For Tinger:

1) Explain project
2) Explain what I've done
3) Look at debt fields
4) Review restatement identification process -- anything different including variables
4) Review 4.4's
5) general review of variables kept/ removed

Second Meeting:

1) Review list to see if there is anything he can spot that I don't need
	-- purple highlights are the notable for review
2) src code -- does he know how to read this to see if there is a restatement (Could map all values to restate y/n and make a dummy var to compare)
3) Thoughts about aggregation -- if rolled up, what would be meaningful -- mean/std/median/etc.
4) Review stock volatility
4) Stocks -- shares outstanding
